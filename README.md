# 🧠 Mood Journal App

A clean and expressive Flutter app built to **learn and understand the `Provider` state management** technique — with a dark aesthetic, dynamic UI, and a sprinkle of emoji magic.

## 🧘‍♂️ Why I Built This

This project is part of my Flutter learning journey — specifically diving deep into **`Provider`**.  
I wanted to build something that looks good *and* helps me practice clean architecture and state handling.  
The result? A mood tracker app with:

- Emoji-based mood logging
- Tagging system
- Notes with timestamp
- A floating action button to add new moods
- State management using `Provider`
